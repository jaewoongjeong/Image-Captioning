# Image Captioning

Currently carrying out research on image captioning at Yamana Laboratory of Waseda University.

I am trying to improve the BLEU-4 score of the caption generated by:
- Incorporating object boundaries using object detection model called Yolov5 in image processing.
- Including tf-idf and embedded pos values in training sentences.
